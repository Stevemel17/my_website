Actually, there are 7 of us, but we did not manage to get a picture of us all :(

Anyway, we always work together and support each other. For example, here is a photo of us preparing for the presentation of our final group project:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/blogs/p2.png", error = FALSE)
```

We made an enormous input in our project and decided to go to our destination city in spring! Hence, this task was extremely useful for us to plan our trip :)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/blogs/pr_name.png", error = FALSE)
```
