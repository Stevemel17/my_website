<p>As you can see from the title page, I adore playing tennis as I played professionally during my childhood. However, I don’t have pictures of me playing with me, but this website might get updated at some point with a beautiful serve or a forehand of mine!</p>
<p>The only thing I like more than playing tennis (and drinking) is travelling. I visited more than 40 countries and have a dream of visiting all of them around the globe! By the way, guess the first foreign country I visited… Greece! However, I was only 1 year old and hardly remember anything. There are some countries that I visit the most like France (30+ times).</p>
<p>Here is a picture from Cannes, France:</p>

<p>Here is a photo from the famous Japanese garden in Monaco:</p>

<p>Outrageous picture on the wall in Baku, Azerbaijan:</p>

<p>And a picture near my home in Moscow just because I love taking pictures :)</p>

<p>What is more, I like skiing and plan to go on a ski trip with LBS Snow club in March. I believe it will be a memory for the whole life! By the way, of course, this is a picture from a ski trip back in 2015:</p>

<p>Travelling also helps me to practice foreigh languages. Recently, I started learning German and would love to try myself in couple of years somewhere in Munich, for example.</p>
<p>I would only add that I like playing team sports like volleyball and football as well!</p>
