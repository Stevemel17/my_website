I graduated with distinction (and first honours for the second diploma) from a double degree programme of Higher School of Economics, a top Russian university, and University of London, a worldwide provider of LSE educational programmes, with an Economics and Finance major in 2020. During my studies, I spent 3 summers interning at United Capital Partners, a Russian PE fund. What is more, I worked as a Teacher Assistant at Higher School of Economics and as a researcher at the Laboratory of Sports Studies of Higher School of Economics and at Skolkovo, Russian Centre of Innovation. After my studies, I decided to stick to the career in finance and started as an Equity Capital Markets intern and was promoted to an analyst in 2 months at Sberbank CIB, a top Russian investment bank. Last summer I switched to Investment Banking Department and completed the Summer Analyst Programme at Citi in Moscow.
 
During my university years, I led a Sports Club student body, played in and coached afterwards an amateur university team, and became the Best Student of the 2018/2019 academic year. After completing my Bachelorâ€™s studies and I studied at School of Finance, practical finance courses taught by employees of top bulge bracket banks, and graduated with distinction. My team and I won the M&A case of the School of Finance as well. I feel that my LBS Degree will help me to globalise my professional experience and cultural exposure. What is more, I am ready to use every opportunity to make new connections and friends from different backgrounds and from all over the world.
