We did our project based on the data for Amsterdam. Here is the summary slide of what we did:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/blogs/pr.png", error = FALSE)
```

Yes, we learnt a lot. Yes, R is good (but I prefer python, sorry, haha) and powerful. What is important, we spent time together and had a lot of fun. We enjoyed Kostis' classes and jokes, supported each other through assignments and side things, and made plans for the future. Look how beautiful Amsterdam is!

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/blogs/amst.png", error = FALSE)
```

Thank you so much for this opportunity and this project!
