<p>We did our project based on the data for Amsterdam. Here is the summary slide of what we did:</p>

<p>Yes, we learnt a lot. Yes, R is good (but I prefer python, sorry, haha) and powerful. What is important, we spent time together and had a lot of fun. We enjoyed Kostisâ€™ classes and jokes, supported each other through assignments and side things, and made plans for the future. Look how beautiful Amsterdam is!</p>

<p>Thank you so much for this opportunity and this project!</p>
